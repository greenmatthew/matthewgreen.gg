            A local multiplayer party game where 2-4 players vote on a map. Then race to the finish in back to back rounds, whilst placing items before the start of each round. These items either making the chosen map easier or more difficult.

            A hobby of mine is building and working on an old server computer. I use it for various things such as hosting this website, a personal Git website, a Minecraft game server, and much more.
            <br><br>
            I have many future plans for building a custom server computer as well as putting my own personal desktop on the server rack. Then using fiber optic to connect to my desktop from the server rack to my desk.
