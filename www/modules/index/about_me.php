        Hi, I am Matthew Green a fresh 21-year-old graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Arlington back in December. Now I would like to start a career in video game programming. Ever since I took a programming and game design course back in high school it has been my dream to program video games. Eventually I would like to try and make my own games, as I feel I have a natural habit of coming up with amazing ideas and would like to make games that I want to play a reality for myself and others to enjoy. However first I need to gain more experience and save up money to do something like that full time. Right now, it is just something to do in my free time.

        After all the classes I have taken from high school to college and from my current job, I have 4 to 5 years of programming experience in many different languages and over a year of experience using Unity. I would say I am incredibly comfortable programming in general and with Unity by myself after all these years. I have been interested in learning Unreal Engine as well as Bevy, an open-source game engine, and the programming language used for it; Rust. While I really like all parts of programming a game and although I have only just started learning about this topic I think graphics programming is what piques my interest the most. More specifically procedural generation, shaders, and hardware acceleration using a graphics card. I did take a computer graphics class, however, in my opinion it was quite a letdown on the amount of content it covered. It was unfortunate that my university did not have anything more on these topics because I would have loved to learn more about this fascinating subject back in school.

        Some more about me and what I like to get up to in my free time. I love everything entertainment. Whether it be watching YouTube videos, playing video games with my friends, or collecting and watching movies. I also put a lot of time into self-hosting with my server computer, hosting many different services for my entertainment or utility, including this website.

        Now here is a showcase of all my projects, work experience, skills, and education.
