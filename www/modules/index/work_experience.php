                    I was hired by <a href="https://www.uta.edu/academics/faculty/profile?username=fernande#About%20Me">Dr.
                        Raul Fernandez</a>, of the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department at UTA, to
                    work individually on a <a href="https://www.matthewgreen.gg/cad_model_viewer.php">VR
                        application</a>. The application is meant to help students learn about the concepts of
                    Computer Aided Design (CAD) in a new 3D virtual environment. The benefits of using VR is to
                    allow students to interact with the CAD models and concepts in a way that is not possible in
                    a 2D environment. The application is built using Unity Engine and C#.

                    Upon receiving my Pharmacy Technician Trainee Certification and was promoted to a Designated
                    Hitter allowing me to work in the pharmacy as well. I would help organize prescriptions, run
                    the pharmacy cash register, and train to become a Pharmacy Technician. Unfortunately, I had
                    to quit because of the pandemic.
